Description: key:value data store for persistent memory
 Pmemkv is a family of key:value stores, developed with persistent memory
 in mind -- yet rather than being tied to a single backing implementation,
 it presents a common interface to a number of engines, both provided by
 pmemkv itself and external.
 .
 This package contains the development headers.
